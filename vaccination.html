                        <h3>COVID-19 affects all age groups; however, morbidity & mortality is several times higher in
                            adults particularly in those above the age of 50 years. Children have either asymptomatic or
                            mild infection. The general practice is to first evaluate any new vaccine in older
                            population and then age reduction is done to assess the safety and effectiveness in
                            paediatric population. The currently available vaccines have not been evaluated in children
                            so far. There are some clinical trials now underway to test the effectiveness and safety of
                            the COVID-19 vaccines in children.</h3>
